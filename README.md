# Comparison of omics data type properties
This repository contains the necessary data and code to generate Figure 3 in 
**Tarzona et al. (2021): “Undisclosed, unmet and neglected challenges in multi-omics studies”, *Nature Computational Sciences***.

To view the vignette, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ConesaLab/Perspective_Multi-Omics_Integration.git
```

...or click on the 'Code' button at the top to download it as a .zip file.

Once you are inside the *Perspective_Multi-Omics_Integration* folder, open the `Figure3_notebook.html` file 
and follow the vignette to perform the analyses and generate the plots.

If you wish to edit/inspect the code or run it chunk by chunk, you can play around with the 
`Figure3_notebook.Rmd` and `Figure3_functions.R` files.
